   - **Features:** Dependency analysis, control flow visualization, data flow analysis.
   - **Best For:** Codebases needing an in-depth structural understanding, especially in embedded systems.

### **8. jQAssistant**
   - **Description:** An architecture analysis tool that uses rules and queries to enforce structure in Java projects.
   - **Features:** Detects architecture violations, enforces constraints, and generates code structure reports.
   - **Best For:** Java applications needing architecture governance and rule enforcement.

### **9. SonarQube (with Architecture Plugins)**
   - **Description:** Primarily a code quality tool, SonarQube also has plugins to visualize dependencies and track architecture.
   - **Features:** Architectural dependency analysis (with plugins), code quality metrics, and maintainability assessments.
   - **Best For:** Organizations already using SonarQube, wanting additional architecture insights.
